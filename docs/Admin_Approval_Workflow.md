## 1. Overview

The Admin Approval Workflow is a comprehensive system that enables school administrators to review, approve, reject, or request revisions for parent enrollment applications. The system ensures data integrity through automatic form locking after approval and provides complete audit trails for compliance purposes.

### 1.1 Key Features

- **Comprehensive Review Process**: Admins can approve, reject, or request specific revisions
- **Automatic Form Locking**: Forms are permanently locked after admin approval
- **Multi-Email Notifications**: All parent email addresses receive status updates
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every admin action is logged with timestamps and details
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant notifications via Supabase Realtime
- **Permission-based Access**: Role-based authorization for all approval actions

### 1.2 Business Requirements

- All enrollment applications **must** be reviewed and approved by school administrators
- Parents **cannot** edit forms once they have been approved by admins
- All approval status changes **must** trigger notifications to all verified parent email addresses
- Complete audit trail **must** be maintained for regulatory compliance
- Average processing time should be **≤ 3 days** from submission to decision

## 2. Approval Workflow States

### 2.1 Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Parent Actions | Admin Actions |
|--------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **pending** | Forms completed by parent, awaiting admin review | View status only | Approve, Reject, Request Revision |
| **approved** | Admin has approved the enrollment | View only (forms locked) | View history only |
| **rejected** | Admin has rejected the enrollment | Can resubmit after addressing issues | View history, Change to pending |
| **needs_revision** | Admin requests specific changes | Edit unlocked forms only | Approve, Reject after revision |

---

## 5. Form Locking Mechanism

### 5.1 Automatic Locking Process

#### 5.1.1 Lock Trigger Conditions
- Enrollment status changes to **approved**
- All required forms have been completed
- Admin approval action is successfully processed
- Audit record is created

#### 5.1.2 Lock Implementation
```sql
-- Form locking function (executed automatically)
UPDATE enrollments 
SET 
    admin_approval_status = 'approved',
    approved_at = NOW(),
    approved_by = :admin_id,
    approval_notes = :notes,
    forms_locked_at = NOW()  -- Critical: Lock timestamp
WHERE id = :enrollment_id;
```

### 5.2 Lock Validation

#### 5.2.1 Pre-submission Validation
Every form submission is validated against the lock status:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SUBMIT[Form Submission Attempt] --> CHECK_STATUS{Check Enrollment Status}
    
    CHECK_STATUS -->|approved + locked| BLOCK[Block Submission]
    CHECK_STATUS -->|pending/needs_revision| ALLOW[Allow Submission]
    
    BLOCK --> LOG_ATTEMPT[Log Blocked Attempt]
    BLOCK --> ERROR_RESPONSE[Return Error to Parent]
    
    ALLOW --> VALIDATE[Validate Form Data]
    VALIDATE --> PROCESS[Process Submission]
```

#### 5.2.2 Error Responses for Locked Forms
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "https://api.goddard.com/errors/form-locked",
    "title": "Form Submission Not Allowed",
    "status": 403,
    "detail": "Cannot process form submission - enrollment has been approved and forms are locked",
    "enrollment_id": "enrollment-uuid",
    "approval_status": "approved",
    "forms_locked_at": "2024-01-16T14:30:00Z",
    "approved_by": "Sarah Johnson"
  }
}
```
